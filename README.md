# Think Before You Ping

A tiny, universal clarity tool that helps people think before they ping someone for help.

## The Problem

People often reach out asking for help, favors, advice, or collaboration—but they show up completely unprepared. No context. No details. No clarity. Just a vague message that wastes everyone's time.

Sound familiar?

- "Bro can you help me?"
- "Quick question"
- "Can I call you?"
- "I have an idea…"
- "I need something built…"

All of these require you to guess what they actually want.

## The Solution

**Think Before You Ping** flips the responsibility. Before reaching out, users fill out a simple form that forces them to:

1. **Clarify** what they actually need
2. **Explain** why they need it
3. **Set expectations** for what they're asking
4. **Show effort** by documenting what they've already tried
5. **Be specific** about timeline, budget, and success criteria

The result? A clean, professional PDF they can share with you (or anyone) before the ping. No more guessing. No more back-and-forth. Just clarity.

## How It Works

1. **Open** thinkbeforeyouping.me
2. **Fill out** the form with details about your request
3. **Generate** a professional PDF
4. **Share** the PDF before you ping someone

That's it.

## What Gets Included in the PDF

- Request title and requester info
- Overview of what you need
- Context and purpose
- Who it's for
- Clear expectations
- What you've already tried
- Timeline
